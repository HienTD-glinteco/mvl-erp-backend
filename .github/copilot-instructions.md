# Copilot Instructions for This Repository

## 1. General Principles
- **Language:** All code, comments, variable names, and documentation must be in **English**.
- **User-Facing Strings:** All strings intended for the end-user must be wrapped in Django's translation functions (e.g., `gettext` or `_()`).
- **Clarity and Simplicity:** Write clear, maintainable, and self-explanatory code. Follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.

## 2. Project Architecture & Structure
This project is a Django application with a modular architecture.

* **Django Apps:** The project is divided into distinct Django 'apps' (e.g., `core`, `hrm`, `crm`). Each app has a specific business function. When adding a new feature, identify the correct app to place it in. If the feature is large and distinct enough, propose creating a new app.
* **Module Responsibility:** Adhere strictly to the separation of concerns within each app:
    * `models.py`: Contains only Django model definitions and their methods. For table-related logic, use a custom QuerySet or Manager.
    * `queryset.py`: Contains custom `QuerySet` classes with table-level methods.
    * `views.py`: Contains API view logic for handling requests and responses. Keep views thin.
    * `serializers.py`: Defines DRF serializers for data validation, serialization, and deserialization.
    * `filters.py`: Contains custom FilterSet classes that extend Django Filters FilterSet, used in views and viewsets, unless there are explicit instructions from human.
    * `urls.py`: Manages URL routing for the app.
    * `permissions.py`: Holds custom permission classes for access control.
    * `utils.py`: Contains reusable helper functions specific to the app.
    * `constants.py`: Stores choices, enums, and other constant values to avoid hard-coding.
* **Modularity:** If a module like `models.py` or `views.py` becomes too large, convert it into a package (a directory with an `__init__.py` file that imports only the most important symbols/objects and wraps them in `__all__`) and split the logic into multiple files (e.g., `models/user.py`, `models/profile.py`).
* **Configuration:** All project settings are located in the `settings/` directory. Do not modify settings without a clear and approved reason.

## 3. Coding Style & Linting
- The codebase must strictly adhere to our linting and formatting rules.
- **Tools:** We use `ruff` for both linting and code formatting, and `mypy` for static type checking.
- **Pre-commit:** You MUST run the `pre-commit` hooks to format and lint your code before pushing any changes.

## 4. Testing
- **TDD Approach:** Always write tests **before** implementing or modifying code. The tests should cover important business logic.
- **AAA Pattern:** Structure all tests using the Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) pattern.
    1.  **Arrange:** Set up the test data and initial state using Django ORM objects.
    2.  **Act:** Execute the function or make the API call you are testing.
    3.  **Assert:** Verify the outcome is as expected.
- **Database:** Do **not** mock the database unless there are explicit human instructions. Create real model instances for testing via the Django ORM.
- **Fixtures:** Reuse test data by creating Pytest fixtures. For widely used fixtures, define them in a higher-level `conftest.py` file to broaden their scope.
- **Execution:** Always run relevant tests after making changes to ensure nothing is broken.

## 5. Documentation & Internationalization (i18n)
* **Docstrings & Comments:** Document all public modules, classes, and functions with clear docstrings. Use comments to explain complex or non-obvious logic.
* **API Documentation:** You must use `drf-yasg` to add decorators and docstrings to API Views and ViewSets. This ensures that our API documentation is automatically generated and up-to-date.
* **Diagrams:** For any new feature or refactor that significantly impacts a workflow, you must generate a diagram (e.g., sequence, flowchart) using Mermaid format and save it in the project's shared documentation folder.
* **Translation Files (PO):** Before committing, update the `.po` translation files.
    * Rerun `makemessages` to update all `msgid` entries and metadata.
    * Add translations for any new strings.
    * Resolve any strings marked as "fuzzy".
    * If a string's meaning is ambiguous, investigate its context. Add a context comment in the code (e.g., `_("...") # CONTEXT: ...`) and the `.po` file to clarify its meaning for translators. If still unclear, ask the project lead.

## 6. Version Control (Git)
* **Branching:** All work must be done on a feature or fix branch created from `master`. Never commit directly to `master`.
* **Branch Naming Convention:** Branch names should be descriptive and follow these rules:
    * Use the related issue's title as the basis for the branch name, not random strings.
    * Convert the issue title to lowercase.
    * Strip special characters (keep only alphanumeric characters and hyphens).
    * Remove leading and trailing spaces.
    * Replace spaces with hyphens (`-`).
    * Keep the branch name concise and not too long (ideally under 50 characters).
    * **Example:** Issue title "Update Copilot Instructions" â†’ branch name `update-copilot-instructions`
* **Commit Messages:** Follow the Conventional Commits specification.
    * **Format:** `type(scope): short description` (e.g., `feat(hrm): add employee performance review model`).
    * **Description:** The body of the commit message should explain **why** the change was made, not just **what** was changed.

## 7. Security Best Practices
* **Secrets:** **NEVER** hard-code sensitive information (API keys, passwords, secret keys). Always use environment variables.
* **Input Validation:** Always validate and sanitize all user-provided input, especially from API requests, using DRF serializers.
* **Database Queries:** Use the Django ORM exclusively for database interactions. Avoid raw SQL queries to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.

## 8. Dependencies
* Do **not** add any new third-party libraries or packages to the project without prior discussion and approval from the team lead.
