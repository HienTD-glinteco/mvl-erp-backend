# CI/CD Quick Reference Guide

## What Runs When

### On Pull Request to `master`
All three CI jobs run in parallel:

| Job | What It Checks | Typical Time (cached) | Fails If |
|-----|----------------|----------------------|----------|
| **lint** | MyPy type checking on `apps/`, `libs/`, `settings/` | ~1-2 min | Type errors found |
| **django-checks** | Django system checks (models, migrations, etc.) | ~1 min | System check errors |
| **test** | Unit tests + coverage | ~3-4 min | Test failures, coverage issues |

All jobs must pass for PR to be merged.

### On Push to `master`
Same as PR, **plus** automatic deployment to test environment if all jobs pass.

## Viewing Results

### GitHub Actions Tab
1. Go to repository ‚Üí Actions tab
2. Click on your workflow run
3. See all jobs at once (parallel execution)
4. Click any job to see detailed logs

### Check Status in PR
- ‚úÖ Green checkmark = All jobs passed
- ‚ùå Red X = At least one job failed
- üü° Yellow circle = Jobs running
- Click "Details" to see which job failed

## Common Failures and Fixes

### MyPy Type Errors (lint job)
```bash
# Run locally before pushing
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m mypy apps/ libs/ settings/ --ignore-missing-imports
```

### Django System Check Errors (django-checks job)
```bash
# Run locally
ENVIRONMENT=test python manage.py check
```

### Test Failures (test job)
```bash
# Run all tests locally
ENVIRONMENT=test pytest apps/ -v

# Run specific test file
ENVIRONMENT=test pytest apps/hrm/tests/test_models.py -v

# Run with coverage
ENVIRONMENT=test pytest apps/ --cov=apps --cov-report=html
```

## Cache Behavior

### When Cache Hits
- Dependencies install in ~20 seconds
- Poetry installation in ~10 seconds
- Total setup time: ~30-40 seconds per job

### When Cache Misses
- Happens when `poetry.lock` changes
- Dependencies install in ~2-3 minutes
- Subsequent runs will be cached

### Force Cache Refresh
If you need to force a cache refresh:
1. Update `poetry.lock` (e.g., run `poetry update`)
2. Or, modify the cache key in `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`

## Performance Tips

### ‚úÖ DO:
- Push small, focused changes
- Run tests locally before pushing
- Keep dependencies up to date
- Use `git commit --amend` for small fixes (before pushing)

### ‚ùå DON'T:
- Push broken code just to "see if CI catches it"
- Add unnecessary dependencies
- Skip local testing
- Create massive PRs (harder to debug when CI fails)

## Debugging Failed CI

### Step 1: Identify Which Job Failed
Look at the workflow summary - failed jobs are marked with ‚ùå

### Step 2: Check the Job Logs
Click the failed job ‚Üí Expand the failed step ‚Üí Read the error

### Step 3: Reproduce Locally
```bash
# For lint failures
python -m mypy apps/ libs/ settings/ --ignore-missing-imports

# For django-checks failures
ENVIRONMENT=test python manage.py check

# For test failures
ENVIRONMENT=test pytest apps/ -v --tb=short
```

### Step 4: Fix and Push
```bash
# Make your fixes
git add .
git commit -m "fix: resolve CI failure"
git push
```

CI will automatically run again on the new push.

## Comparing with Old Workflow

| Aspect | Old Workflow | New Workflow |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| Execution | Sequential (one after another) | Parallel (all at once) |
| Feedback Time | ~8-10 minutes | ~3-4 minutes |
| Cache | Broken (always reinstalls) | Working (caches properly) |
| MyPy Scope | Entire directory | Project code only |
| Django Checks DB | PostgreSQL | SQLite (faster) |
| Visibility | Single job (hard to see what failed) | Multiple jobs (easy to see) |

## Advanced: Running CI Locally

### Using Act (GitHub Actions locally)
```bash
# Install act
brew install act  # macOS
# or
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nektos/act/master/install.sh | sudo bash

# Run the lint job
act -j lint

# Run all jobs
act pull_request
```

### Using Docker Compose
```bash
# Coming soon - local CI environment
```

## Need Help?

### CI/CD Issues
1. Check this guide
2. Check the main [CICD.md](CICD.md) documentation
3. Check the [CI_OPTIMIZATION_SUMMARY.md](CI_OPTIMIZATION_SUMMARY.md)
4. Ask in team Slack channel

### Workflow Modifications
- Requires approval from team lead
- Test changes in a feature branch first
- Document any changes made

## Monitoring CI Performance

### Key Metrics to Watch
- Average run time (target: <5 minutes)
- Cache hit rate (target: >80%)
- Failure rate (target: <20%)
- Time to feedback (target: <4 minutes)

### Where to Check
- GitHub Actions ‚Üí Workflow runs
- Repository Insights ‚Üí Actions tab
- Weekly CI/CD performance reports
